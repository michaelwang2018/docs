## Authentication

Mielto uses a dual authentication scheme supporting both Bearer tokens and session-based authentication. Most endpoints require authentication.

```json
"security": [
  {
    "DualAuthScheme": []
  }
]
```

### Getting Started

1. **Register** a new account via `/api/v1/auth/register`
2. **Login** to receive authentication tokens via `/api/v1/auth/login`
3. **Include** the Bearer token in the Authorization header for all requests
4. **Use** workspace headers (`X-Workspace-Id`) for workspace-scoped operations
