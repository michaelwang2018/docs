## Authentication

Mielto uses API key authentication for secure, scalable access to all endpoints. API keys provide persistent authentication without the need for login sessions.

```bash
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY
```

### Getting Started

1. **Create** an API key via `/api/v1/api-keys`
2. **Include** the API key in the Authorization header as a Bearer token
3. **Secure** your API key - treat it like a password
4. **Manage** keys programmatically with create, update, and delete endpoints
